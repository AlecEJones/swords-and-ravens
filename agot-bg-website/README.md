# Swords and Ravens - Website

The Django project is composed of 3 apps:

* `agotboardgame_main` contains the user-facing website itself
* `api` contains the REST API used by the game server to communicate with the website.
* `chat` contains the Websocket server powering both the chatbox on the website, and the chats in the games.
