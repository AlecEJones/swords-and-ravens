                    At the moment, the focus is to finish implementing the base game and polish the existing features.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final goal is to implement all the release gameplay of the extensions (Feast for Crows, Dance
                    with Dragons and Mother of Dragons), and add meta-game features (abuse reports, ranked games, ...).
                </p>

                    The implementation of the <strong>rules</strong> of the game is the priority. Feel free to play as
                    you want, but don't hesitate to check if the game reacts correctly to <strong>edge cases</strong> (special
                    combinations of house cards, for example).
